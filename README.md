## Data

Data from the 2019 study referenced in "Automatic Generation of Typicality Measures for Spatial Language in Grounded Settings" and "Modelling the Polysemy of Spatial Prepositions in Referring Expressions" is given in `Analysis` folder along with Python code for data analysis. The data is also formally archived at: https://doi.org/10.5518/764

For figures, data and scores accompanying the "Modelling the Polysemy of Spatial Prepositions in Referring Expressions" paper, see the `polysemy` folder.

Data from the 2020 study referenced in "Categorisation, Typicality & Object-Specific Features in Spatial Referring Expressions" is given in `Analysis` folder along with Python code for data analysis. The data is also formally archived at: https://doi.org/10.5518/873
