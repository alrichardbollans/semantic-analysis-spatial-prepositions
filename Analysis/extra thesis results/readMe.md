# Folders

## 2019 study cat typ comparison
This folder contains results of comparing categorisation and typicality judgements in the 2019 study (as opposed to the 2020 study).
Generated by extra_thesis_cat_typ.py

## all prepositions
This folder contains results of testing polysemy models on all the prepositions.
Generated by extra_thesis_polysemy.py

## kmeans inertias
Contains plots of inertias generated by clustering with kmeans algorithm and with polysemy models.
Generated using data_clustering.py.

## partition
This folder contains results of testing a 'partition' model which helps to show that improvements given by polysemy models are not simply from partitioning the data. 
Generated by extra_thesis_polysemy.py

## refined models
This folder contains results of testing a refined polysemy models, typicalities assigned by these models as well as properties of the refined model.
Generated by extra_thesis_polysemy.py.

## sr_typ_plots
Contains plots comparing typicality generated by models with selection ratio.
Generated by extra_thesis_cat_typ.py

## unsatisfied contraints
Contains list of constraints from the Comparative Task which are unsatisfied by the models.
Generated by extra_thesis_polysemy.py

## updated kfold
Contains results of kfold cross validation where train-test splits are created using participants rather than scenes.
